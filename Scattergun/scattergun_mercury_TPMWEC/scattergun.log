Entropy = 7.999958 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 4194304 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 4194304 samples is 242.59, and randomly
would exceed this value 70.17 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4853 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.143214362 (error 0.05 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000255 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
